# Elysia MVC
> ðŸš§ WORK IN PROGRESS!

Example of MVC architecture with a cutting edge tech stack. It includes:
- Elysia for handling routing
- Drizzle ORM for database interaction (SQLite for development and Turso for production)
- TSX as template engine (shipping 0 javascript by default!)
- Vite for bundling frontend assets

It is intended to be used as a boilerplate for my personal projects. Documenation will come when it is finished!
